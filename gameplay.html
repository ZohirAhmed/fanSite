		<p> Vainglory has a lot of areas to learn to get good at but, it isnt that difficlut to learn these different areas. For beginners all you need to learn is how to play the three different roles captain,jungle, and carry. For people in the middle ranks you need to learn how to place vision such as scout traps and flares down properly. Finally, for high ranked players you must know how to rotate, steal farm, push, teamfight, and many more. As I said earlier vainglory is a 3v3 moba game which means the lane is a very important position in the game to be dominant in. The lane is the area on the map where all the turrets are positioned. Therefore, you must be dominant in the lane because it also has a lot of minion to kill making it rich in gold and if you aquire gold you can buy items to improve your characters stats. The game also has many different modes such as casual,ranked,blitz,battleroyale, and practice. Casual and ranked are the main game mode and are basically the same thing but, ranked has more at risk. The casual and rank game mode lasts about 20-25 mins on average. The next game mode is blitz which is a mode that has a 5 min time limit and the team with the most points by the end of 5 mins wins or the first team to reach 15 points. To get points in the blitz mode you must kill opponents for 1 point and kill a turret, gold miner, and cystal centry for 3 points each. Next, we have the battleroyale game mode where you get a random hero and you have to fight in the lane because the jungle is blocked and the hardest part to this game mode is you can't go home or shop unless you die. This makes the mode more interesting because everyone has to fall at some point. This game mode typically lasts about 10-15 mins. Finally, we have the practice mode where is basically an anything goes game mode where you can only play with friends and in this mode you can use any hero even the ones you haven't unlocked to fight with infinite gold and max level the whole game. </p>
