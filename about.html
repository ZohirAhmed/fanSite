			<p>Vainglory is a mobile 3v3 MOBA that is for players of all ages. Vainglory contains currently contains 38 heroes in update 2.10. What I enjoy about vainglory is it's online multiplayer platform because the game allows you to partner up with 2 other friends and play online with people from all over the world. In vainglory you can also create 10 people parties and enjoy having fun with multiple friends. As I said earlier vainglory is a MOBA which stands for multiplayer online battle arena. A moba game is a type of game where you have to farm by killing monsters and minions and destroy turrets so you can eventually push into the enemy base and destroy their crytal which is the main boss in moba games. The only thing thats keeping you from destroying the turrets is the enemy team which will try their hardest to push your team back. What I am most excited about in vainglory is the next update because it will introduce a 5v5 format to vainglory which means you can now play online with more friends in a new and improved map and playstyle.</p>
