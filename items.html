		Items are an essential part of Vainglory and this is because they can change the amount of damage you deal and take. Items can be found and bought in the shop. There are 5 item groups in the game. The item groups are weapon, crystal, defense, utility, and consumables. Weapon items are for basic attacks which are really good for heroes that have high attack stats. Carries usually buy weapon items. Crystal items help power up abilities and shorten ability cooldowns. Heroes who have powerful abilities tend to go a crystal build path. Next, we have the defense items which increase your heroes overall defense stats and it helps you sustain in battle for longer. Then, we have the utility items which are items that are bought based on the situations taking place in the game. For example, you might need to buy a contraption item if the other teams likes to hide in the bushes a lot. Finally, we have the consumable items which are items that give you a temporary boost and you keep buying consumables whenever you need because the costs for consumables are pretty cheap. Now I will tell the most popular item for each build path. Weapon- Sorrowblade, Crystal- Shatterglass, Defense- Aegis/Fountain, Utility, Boots, Consumable-Vision and Infusions. This is the summary of what the items are like in Vainglory.
