		<p>Vainglory has 3 roles one for each player. These three roles are Carry, Jungler, and Captain. The Carry is the most important role because the player who carries has the biggest impact on teamfights and this is because carries do the most damage and they are positioned in the lane so they are the ones who usually start turret pushes and protect their own turret. Next, we have the jungler who's role is to attack jungle minions and level up because the way lane minions are rich in gold the jungle minions are rich in experience and experience helps you level up quicker and upgrade your abilities. The jungler also can steal the enemy junglers farm and put the enemy behind in teamfights. The last task for a jungler is to ambush the enemy carry by hiding in the brush and waiting for an opportunity to strike, this is important because as I said earlier the carry is most important in teamfights and if the carry keeps getting ambushed it will eventually fall behind in gold. Finally, we have the captain the role that requires the most skill in my opinion because as a captain your job is to protect your teammates and try keeping them alive as long as possible in teamfights. Captains must also place vision around the map so the team can have better map awareness. These are my favorite heroes for each role, Carry-Vox and Idris, Jungler-Taka and Koshka, Captain-Lorelai and Ardan.</p>
